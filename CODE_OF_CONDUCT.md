# nhkltui Code of Conduct

We want to provide a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free environment for all people.

## Permissions

We do not allow any form of harassment, intimidation, or discrimination (e.g., racism, sexism, or any -ism).

EVERYONE needs to have a welcoming and inclusive environment.
You also need to be respectful of others independent of your gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or
any other personal characteristic.

Self-promotion is not allowed.

## Reporting a Violation

If you see a violation of this code, please report it to the project maintainers through the Report
category in the Discussions tab of the project. ([here](https://github.com/nhkl-gh/tui/discussions/categories/report))

Pleas, follow this template so we can help you and understand what happened (replace the
things in angle brackets with the appropriate information):

```plaintext
VIOLATION OF CODE OF CONDUCT FROM <the violator's username> FROM <your username>

<the violator> violated the code of conduct by <the violation>.

Prove:

<prove the violation>
```

If you want, you can also make the report anonymous by sending this to the `Anonymous Reports` category
(and don't forget to remove your username from the report).

## Moderation

The moderators of the project will review all reports and take appropriate action.

Rules for moderators:

- Also follow the regular code of conduct
- Don't directly ban, instead, report
- **DO NOT** accept any kind of deal that implies banning someone without him/her doing anything (that
isn't on the code of conduct). **YOU WILL BE BANNED** if you do that.
